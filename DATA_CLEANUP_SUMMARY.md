# Data Cleanup Summary

## ‚úÖ **Completed:**

### 1. **Date/Time Standardization** 
- Added 5 PM default time to 24 dates that had no time specified
- Primarily Pima County and Maricopa County jobs
- Format: `mm/dd/yy hh:mm PM`

### 2. **Bad Data Removal**
Deleted incorrectly scraped jobs from:
- Town of Florence (1 job) - was scraping Help Center link
- Town of Queen Creek (1 job) - was scraping Help Center link  
- City of Chandler (1 job) - was scraping home page
- City of Surprise (1 job) - fixed and can be re-scraped

## üîß **Cities Needing Attention:**

### **1. Town of Florence**
**Current Config:**
- URL: `https://procurement.opengov.com/portal/florenceaz`
- Type: OpenGov portal with Cloudflare
- Status: ‚ùå **Scraping Help Center links instead of jobs**

**Recommendations:**
- May have no current bids/RFPs (check manually: https://procurement.opengov.com/portal/florenceaz)
- If empty, that's correct behavior
- If has jobs, needs `undetected_chromedriver` for Cloudflare bypass
- Already configured with `uses_cloudflare: true`

---

### **2. Town of Queen Creek**
**Current Config:**
- URL: `https://procurement.opengov.com/portal/queencreekaz`
- Type: OpenGov portal with Cloudflare
- Status: ‚ùå **Scraping Help Center links instead of jobs**

**Recommendations:**
- Same as Florence - check if portal has jobs
- Already configured with `uses_cloudflare: true`
- May need wait time adjustment or different selector

---

### **3. City of Chandler**
**Current Config:**
- URL: `https://www.chandleraz.gov/business/vendor-services/purchasing/requests-for-bids-and-proposals`
- Status: ‚ùå **Complex situation**

**User Notes:**
- Has TWO separate sites:
  1. One for "qualifications"
  2. One for "bids"
- To actually apply, must go to State of Arizona website
- Requires username/password for details
- Has robust/complicated table with thousands of records

**Recommendations:**
- **Option A**: Find the actual procurement portal URLs (may be links on the page above)
- **Option B**: Use **Manual Entry via Parsing Tool**
  - Copy/paste job listings into the parsing tool at bottom of RFQ list
  - The tool will extract RFP numbers, titles, and due dates

---

## üõ†Ô∏è **Manual Parsing Tool**

**Location**: Bottom of main RFQ list in UI

**How It Works:**
1. Enter organization name
2. Paste text containing job listings
3. Click "Parse Text"
4. API endpoint `/parse_text` extracts:
   - RFP numbers (pattern: `RFP #[...]`)
   - Titles
   - Due dates (looks for "End Date" or "Due Date")
   - Auto-assigns work types

**Best For:**
- Complex sites like Chandler
- One-off manual entries
- Sites requiring authentication
- PDF bulletins

---

## üìã **Next Steps:**

### **Priority 1: Test Scraping Florence & Queen Creek**
Run scraper for these two to see if they have current jobs or if portals are empty.

### **Priority 2: Find Chandler's Actual Procurement URLs**
Manual inspection of their pages to find:
- Qualifications portal
- Bids portal
- Check if they use AZ State procurement system

### **Priority 3: Test Manual Parsing Tool**
- Get sample data from Chandler
- Test paste ‚Üí parse workflow
- Verify extracted data quality
