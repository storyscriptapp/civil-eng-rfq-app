# RFQ App - Implementation Plan

## ‚úÖ COMPLETED

### 1. Health Monitoring System
- Tracks % changes across runs
- Alerts on anomalies
- Historical data tracking

### 2. Job Tracking & Memory System
- **Unique Job IDs**: Each RFQ gets a stable ID (same job = same ID across scrapes)
- **User Decision Tracking**: Remembers if user marked job as ignored/pursuing/completed
- **Database**: SQLite (`rfq_tracking.db`) stores all jobs and user decisions
- **No Overwrites**: User decisions preserved across scrapes

**How it works:**
```python
# When scraper runs:
1. Scrapes new data
2. Assigns stable job IDs
3. Checks database for existing jobs
4. Preserves user's previous decisions
5. Saves enhanced data with job_id, user_status, user_notes
```

**User decision options:**
- `new` - Just discovered
- `ignore` - Not interested (e.g., credit card processor RFP)
- `pursuing` - Actively working on proposal
- `completed` - Submitted or won
- `declined` - Lost or chose not to bid

## üöß TO-DO (In Priority Order)

### 3. User Filters in React App (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Goal**: Let engineers filter to relevant jobs

**Filters to add:**
- Work type (utility/transportation, maintenance, unknown)
- User status (new, pursuing, ignored, etc.)
- Organization (select cities)
- Date range (due date)
- Keyword search in title
- Status (Open vs Closed)

**Implementation approach:**
```javascript
// In rfq-app/src/App.js
const [filters, setFilters] = useState({
  workType: 'all',
  userStatus: 'all',
  organization: 'all',
  searchTerm: ''
});

const filteredRfqs = rfqs.filter(rfq => {
  if (filters.workType !== 'all' && rfq.work_type !== filters.workType) return false;
  if (filters.userStatus !== 'all' && rfq.user_status !== filters.userStatus) return false;
  if (filters.organization !== 'all' && rfq.organization !== filters.organization) return false;
  if (filters.searchTerm && !rfq.title.toLowerCase().includes(filters.searchTerm.toLowerCase())) return false;
  return true;
});
```

**UI Components needed:**
- Filter sidebar/bar
- Dropdown for work type
- Dropdown for user status
- Search box for keywords
- "Clear filters" button
- Show count: "Showing X of Y RFQs"

**Quick wins:**
- Hide jobs marked as "ignore" by default
- Show "NEW" badge on new jobs
- Color code by work type

### 4. Cloudflare Bypass (HIGH DIFFICULTY)

**Problem**: Florence and Queen Creek have Cloudflare protection

**Options (easiest to hardest):**

#### Option A: Undetected ChromeDriver (EASY - Try First)
```bash
pip install undetected-chromedriver
```

```python
import undetected_chromedriver as uc

# Instead of webdriver.Chrome()
driver = uc.Chrome()
```

Success rate: 60-70% for basic Cloudflare

#### Option B: Playwright with Stealth (MEDIUM)
```bash
pip install playwright playwright-stealth
playwright install
```

```python
from playwright.sync_api import sync_playwright
from playwright_stealth import stealth_sync

# Better at avoiding detection
with sync_playwright() as p:
    browser = p.chromium.launch(headless=False)
    page = browser.new_page()
    stealth_sync(page)  # Apply stealth patches
    page.goto(url)
```

Success rate: 80-85%

#### Option C: Residential Proxies (EXPENSIVE)
Use services like:
- Bright Data ($500+/month)
- Oxylabs ($300+/month)
- ScraperAPI ($50+/month)

Success rate: 95%+

#### Option D: CAPTCHA Solving Services (MODERATE COST)
- 2Captcha ($3 per 1000 solves)
- Anti-Captcha
- CapMonster

#### Option E: API Integration (BEST IF AVAILABLE)
Check if Florence/Queen Creek offer:
- OpenGov API access
- RSS feeds
- Email notifications

**Recommendation**: 
1. Start with **Option A** (undetected-chromedriver) - 5 minutes to implement
2. If that fails, try **Option B** (Playwright stealth) - 30 minutes
3. If still failing, consider **Option D** (CAPTCHA service) - $10-20/month
4. Last resort: **Option C** (proxies) - expensive

## üîú FUTURE ENHANCEMENTS

### 5. Email Notifications
- Daily digest of new RFQs
- Alerts when health checks fail
- Reminder for approaching due dates

### 6. Proposal Tracking
- Link RFQ to proposal documents
- Track proposal status
- Win/loss reporting

### 7. Team Collaboration
- Multi-user support
- Assign RFQs to team members
- Shared notes/comments

### 8. Advanced Filtering
- Estimated project value
- Required certifications
- Geographic proximity
- Historical win rate with city

### 9. Reporting Dashboard
- Win rate by city
- Bid volume trends
- Most profitable cities
- Time spent on proposals

## üìù IMMEDIATE NEXT STEPS

1. **Run the scraper** to see new features:
   ```bash
   cd rfq_scraper
   python multi_scraper.py
   ```

2. **Check outputs:**
   - `rfqs.json` - Now has `job_id`, `user_status`, `first_seen`
   - `rfq_tracking.db` - New database with all jobs
   - `scraper_history.json` - Health monitoring data
   - Console - Health report

3. **Update React app** to show new fields:
   - Display job_id
   - Show "NEW" badge for `user_status == 'new'`
   - Add buttons: "Ignore", "Pursuing", "Completed"

4. **Test job tracking:**
   ```python
   from job_tracking import RFQJobTracker
   tracker = RFQJobTracker()
   
   # Mark a job as ignored
   tracker.update_user_decision('RFQ-abc123', 'ignore', notes='Not our specialty')
   
   # Get all jobs user is pursuing
   pursuing = tracker.get_jobs_by_status('pursuing')
   ```

5. **Try Cloudflare bypass** for Florence/Queen Creek
